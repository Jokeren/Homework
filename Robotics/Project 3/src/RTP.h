           @par Short description
           RTP is a tree-based motion planner that uses the following
           idea: RTP samples a random state @b qr in the state space,
           then finds the state @b qc among the previously seen states
           that is closest to @b qr and expands from @b qc towards @b
           qr, until a state @b qm is reached. @b qm is then added to
           the exploration tree.
